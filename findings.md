    <p>SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Figure 1 shows that the percentages of positive sentiment each year were as follows: 78.0% in 2014, 77.5% in 2015, 80.0% in 2016, 66.0% in 2017, 67.0% in 2018, 70.0% in 2019, 68.0% in 2020, 68.5% in 2021, 72.5% in 2022, and 74.0% in 2023. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that approximately 47.6% of the variance in life satisfaction can be explained by the variance in positive sentiment, closely aligning with the findings of Wu et al. (2022) that social support accounts for 43.4% of life satisfaction, and socio-demographic and job-related factors account for the remaining variance. This finding supports S1, indicating a correlation between positive sentiments in blog posts and higher levels of life satisfaction among North Korean defectors. However, it is important to note that this correlation does not imply causation, and other factors may also influence life satisfaction.

THEMATIC ANALYSIS

Figure 2 illustrates that for the empowerment theme, which emphasizes resilience, personal growth, and success stories, the percentages varied as follows: 45.8% in 2014, 46.2% in 2015, 44.9% in 2016, 42.5% in 2017, 40.3% in 2018, 41.5% in 2019, 39.8% in 2020, 40.6% in 2021, 39.2% in 2022, and 38.9% in 2023. Although it experienced a slight decline in percentage over the years, the empowerment theme consistently emerged as the most prominent narrative. The Pearson correlation analysis between positive sentiment and the empowerment theme percentages indicates a moderate linear relationship. When squared, this correlation suggests that about 43.1% of the variance in positive sentiment can be statistically explained by the variation in the empowerment theme.
           The R-squared value of 43.1% suggests that a significant portion of positive sentiment in blog posts is driven by the empowerment theme. However, it also indicates that more than half of the positive sentiment (56.9%) is influenced by other themes or factors. This means that a substantial part of the positive sentiment is not solely due to empowerment narratives but may be driven by other themes, such as political or societal contexts. This reinforces the concept of conditional acceptance, where positive portrayals of defectors are contingent on their perceived role or utility within broader societal or political narratives rather than purely on their empowerment or intrinsic value.

           However, while the empowerment theme significantly influences positive sentiment, the R-squared value reveals that it only explains 43.1% of the variance in positive sentiment toward North Korean defectors. This suggests that while empowerment and resilience narratives play a significant role in shaping positive sentiment, they are not the sole factors. Other themes and broader societal contexts also contribute to the overall positive sentiment in public discourse.
           The regression analysis between the empowerment theme and positive sentiment underscores the importance of these narratives in enhancing life satisfaction among defectors. Yet, the fact that non-empowerment themes, such as Political and Neutral, collectively explain a larger proportion of positive sentiment suggests that societal acceptance of defectors remains conditional. This conditional inclusion is driven by broader narratives that extend beyond mere empowerment, indicating that defectors must navigate additional societal expectations to gain acceptance.
           These findings suggest that the presence of non-empowerment themes in positive sentiment narratives could be indicative of a conditional nature of inclusion in South Korean society, supporting T2. This highlights the complexity of societal acceptance, where positive portrayals may still be influenced by broader societal expectations and narratives beyond empowerment alone. The significant influence of non-empowerment themes reflects the broader context of conditional inclusion that defectors must contend with to achieve societal acceptance.
