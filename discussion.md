    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      The discussion focuses on analyzing the implications of the findings presented in the previous sections. It explores the broader impact of these findings on the understanding of North Korean defectors' integration into South Korean society. Key areas of focus include the socio-economic challenges faced by defectors, their representation in media, and the role of public opinion in shaping their experiences.

      The study's reliance on Naver blog posts introduces potential biases, as these posts may not fully capture the diverse perspectives within South Korean society. Additionally, the translation process from Korean to English might have led to some loss of nuanced sentiment and thematic context. Future studies could benefit from direct analysis of Korean texts using tools like KoBERT to improve accuracy.

      Despite the limitations, the study provides valuable insights into the conditional inclusion framework applied to North Korean defectors. It highlights the importance of economic and social factors in influencing defectors' integration experiences. Future research should aim to diversify data sources, improve translation methods, and apply advanced NLP techniques to capture more complex narrative structures.
