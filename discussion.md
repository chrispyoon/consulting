    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>This study explores the impact of public sentiment and thematic narratives on the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors, offering insights into the dynamics of their conditional inclusion in South Korean society. The analysis of blog posts from 2014 to 2023 reveals how different themes and sentiments influence the well-being and societal acceptance of defectors. The SA shows a strong correlation between positive sentiment in blog posts and the life satisfaction of defectors. The TA provides that the non-empowerment themes account for approximately 56.9% of the variance in positive sentiment, highlighting the prevalent conditional inclusion in South Korea
           Choi (2016) and Ramasubramanian (2011) suggest that media portrayals significantly shape public perceptions and societal attitudes. The sentiment and thematic analyses from this study support these theories, indicating that positive and empowering media representations correlate with higher life satisfaction. However, this dependence on favorable portrayals for societal acceptance underscores the problematic nature of conditional inclusion, where defectors are valued primarily for their contributions or adherence to positive stereotypes, rather than being accepted unconditionally.
           Moreover, Ramasubramanian's research highlights the broader impact of media stereotypes on societal attitudes and policy support. Applying this framework of conditional inclusion to the portrayal of North Korean defectors, it becomes evident that the reliance on positive portrayals without a dominant empowerment theme perpetuates the idea that defectors must continually prove their worth to gain acceptance. This conditional acceptance can undermine genuine integration and perpetuate systemic biases. As Ramasubramanian (2011) states,

"Exposure to stereotypical rather than counterstereotypical out-group media exemplars increased stereotypical beliefs relating to perceived laziness of African Americans, which in turn led to internal attributions for failures of African Americans, increased prejudicial feelings toward African Americans, and ultimately reduced support for affirmative action policies" (p. 508).

           In conclusion, this study demonstrates that positive sentiment significantly enhances the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors but also reveals the limitations imposed by conditional inclusion. While empowering narratives play a critical role in promoting positive sentiment and societal acceptance, they do not entirely overcome the conditional nature of this acceptance. The significant influence of non-empowerment themes suggests that societal acceptance is still largely conditional, requiring defectors to navigate and conform to broader societal expectations. To achieve genuine integration and well-being for North Korean defectors, it is important to move beyond conditional inclusion and foster a societal framework that embraces defectors unconditionally, acknowledging their inherent worth and diverse contributions to society.
