    <h2>Limitations and Future Study</h2>
    <p>
This study explores how public opinion affects the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors and the conditional inclusion they face in South Korean society. However, it has limitations: reliance on Naver blog posts may not fully capture societal views, and translation from Korean to English could distort sentiment and thematic analysis. Future analyses will use KoBERT for direct Korean text assessment, improving accuracy. The thematic prediction model's low accuracy (less than 30%), discovered late in the research, suggests a need for a larger sample size—potentially over 15,000—to achieve better accuracy. 
           Additionally, thematic classification will expand to include broader themes like cultural assimilation and political utility, using zero-shot learning for classification. Zero-shot learning is essential because BERT requires over 1,000 labeled samples for deep learning, which wasn't feasible given the study’s limitations with only 1,200 posts and my laptop’s limited computational capacity. However, with a Google Colab subscription, I can now handle larger computations. 
           Despite using NLP and machine learning techniques, the study may not fully capture the complexity of narratives or non-linear relationships. Future research should diversify data sources, improve translation accuracy, and use advanced NLP techniques like BERT. Investigating non-linear statistical models and other frameworks could enhance understanding of defectors' integration. Longitudinal studies tracking changes in sentiment and life satisfaction, alongside assessments of policy and community support, could provide richer insights. Expanding Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis with more variables, as suggested by Wu et al. (2022) on social support, could refine understanding.
           This case study explores the concept of conditional inclusion for North Korean defectors in South Korea, relating it to the "good immigrant" versus "bad immigrant" narrative. While it offers useful insights, it doesn’t substantially advance theoretical understanding or address existing research gaps. To address these shortcomings, further literature review and improved data analysis are necessary. My goal is to publish these findings in student journals like the Stanford Undergraduate Research Journal (SURJ) and use this experience to strengthen my application for the 2025 MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP) in GOV/LAB, where I aspire to work under the mentorship of Professor César A. Hidalgo, whose expertise lies in Comparative Politics and the use of advanced text analysis tools to study democratic processes and governance. His research aligns with my goal of pursuing a PhD in comparative politics with a focus on using quantitative methods to analyze democratic systems. This experience will be pivotal in developing my skills and advancing my career as a researcher.
