  <p>This study investigates the impact of public sentiment and thematic narratives on the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors within the framework of Conditional Inclusion. This framework posits that societal acceptance depends on perceived utility and conformity to norms. By analyzing blog posts from 2014 to 2023, the research examines how different themes and sentiments influence the well-being and societal integration of defectors in South Korea. The findings demonstrate that while positive sentiment and empowering narratives contribute to the life satisfaction and societal acceptance of defectors, their integration remains governed by conditional inclusion. To foster genuine acceptance and well-being for North Korean defectors, future research should address broader societal attitudes and policies that support unconditional integration, recognizing their inherent worth and diverse contributions.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Overview</h2>
    <p>Under the South Korean Constitution, North Korean defectors are granted legal status as South Korean nationals. This recognition is crucial against the backdrop of ongoing tensions between the two Koreas and the steady influx of defectors escaping economic hardships and political repression. Over 34,000 defectors have entered South Korea, seeking a better life. Despite their legal status, many faces significant challenges, including economic struggles, social stigma, and difficulties in cultural adaptation.
           The integration of North Korean defectors into South Korean society offers a compelling perspective on broader migration issues and South Korea's commitment to human rights. Central to this integration is the concept of Conditional Inclusionâ€”the idea that defectors' acceptance is dependent on their perceived utility and their ability to conform to societal norms. This study explores whether defectors are genuinely embraced or if their acceptance is conditional on fulfilling certain favorable expectations, such as embodying positive stereotypes.
           The primary objective of this research is to examine the hypothesis that societal acceptance of North Korean defectors in South Korea is conditional. It investigates whether narratives that are positive and empowering enhance societal acceptance. By analyzing these dynamics, the study aims to contribute to a broader discussion on migration, integration, and human rights, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities faced by North Korean defectors. Addressing these issues is essential for fostering an inclusive society that recognizes the intrinsic worth and diverse contributions of defectors, moving beyond the limitations of conditional inclusion.</p>
