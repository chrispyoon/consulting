      North Korean defectors in South Korea face economic struggles, social stigma, and difficulties in cultural adaptation. This study explores whether defectors are genuinely embraced or if their acceptance is conditional on fulfilling certain favorable expectations, such as embodying positive stereotypes.

      The study aims to prove the hypothesis that societal acceptance of North Korean defectors in South Korea is conditional.
