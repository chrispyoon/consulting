    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>I want to express my gratitude to several individuals who greatly supported my research journey. First, thank you to Angela Perkins, the Director of Digital Scholarship Services at Lafayette College, for helping me with my first independent research project. I am also grateful to Associate Professor Caleb Gallemore from the International Affairs Department at Lafayette College for his insights into statistical methods. Yazdan Basir, a Data Engineer at SEI, provided valuable advice on data analysis. Lastly, I appreciate the guidance and mentorship of Associate Professor Seo-Hyun Park from the Government and Law Department and the Asian Studies Program at Lafayette College, who assisted me in conducting my literature review.</p>
