      <h2>Statement from the Founder</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="statement-content" class="statement-details">
      <p><strong>From Pennsylvania, USA</strong></p>
      <p><strong>April 17, 2024</strong></p>

      <h2>Why Study Abroad?</h2>
      <p>Is it to broaden your perspective? Not exactly.<br>
      Is it to develop a keener eye for business opportunities? Not quite.<br>
      Is it to return home with an impressive degree? Not really.</p>

      <p>The true reason to study abroad is to experience different societies, which helps us fully realize our own potential. During my time abroad, I realized that I had been limited by my surroundings, and I could no longer aim for success based on a single society's standards.</p>

      <p>We live in a time where old traditions, outdated systems, and modern advancements all mix together. To navigate this complex world, we need individuals who can see beyond the familiar. Experiencing and understanding the world firsthand is crucial to making meaningful change.</p>

      <p><strong>I am here to help you have this experience in the heart of the world: the United States. I want to ensure that you don't just settle for a prestigious degree but truly grow and challenge yourself.</strong></p>

      <h2>The Reason I Started Free College Consulting</h2>
      <p>I realized I am not alone in my journey.</p>

      <p>I met someone who inspired me to share everything I've learned and experienced.</p>

      <p>He is an orphan, comes from a humble background, and is driven by a desire to solve global medical issues. His story made me see the value in guiding others like him.</p>

      <p><strong>I won't wait for people like him to find me by chance. I will seek out those with strong critical thinking, big dreams, and the determination to make them a reality, and bring them to the forefront.</strong></p>

      <h2>A Brief Introduction About Myself</h2>
      <p>I grew up in South Korea, the Philippines, and the United States. I am the first Korean male high school dropout to attend a top 30 Liberal Arts College in the US on a scholarship. My journey is unique, and I've met many students with challenging backgrounds. I want to find and support others like my past self.</p>

      <p>I have offered free US college scholarship consulting to acquaintances and served as a board member for refugee support organizations, but I feel I can do more. When I first ventured into studying abroad, attempted to drop out, published a book, or prepared for scholarship applications, the lack of senior guidance was frustrating and daunting.</p>

      <p><strong>I want to make sure you don't have to struggle as much as I did. I plan to organize a gathering in New York soon, and I sincerely hope you will be there.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Best,<br>Chris Yoon</strong></p>
