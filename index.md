    <p>I want to express my gratitude to several individuals who greatly supported my research journey. First, thank you to Angela Perkins, the Director of Digital Scholarship Services at Lafayette College, for supporting me with my first machine learning research project. I am also grateful to Associate Professor Caleb Gallemore from the International Affairs Department at Lafayette College for his insights into statistical methods. Yazdan Basir, a Data Engineer at SEI, provided valuable advice on data analysis. I also thank Sidath Chandrasena, DHSSâ€™2023 teaching fellow, for his persistent feedback. Lastly, I am grateful for the mentorship provided by Associate Professor Seo-Hyun Park of the Government and Law Department and the Asian Studies Program at Lafayette College, who generously shared her expertise and guidance.</p>
