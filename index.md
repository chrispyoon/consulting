    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
    <p>I want to express my gratitude to several individuals who greatly supported my research journey. First, thank you to Angela Perkins, the Director of Digital Scholarship Services at Lafayette College, for helping me with my first independent research project. I am also grateful to Associate Professor Caleb Gallemore from the International Affairs Department at Lafayette College for his insights into statistical methods. Yazdan Basir, a Data Engineer at SEI, provided valuable advice on data analysis. I am deeply grateful for the invaluable support and mentorship provided by Associate Professor Seo-Hyun Park of the Government and Law Department and the Asian Studies Program at Lafayette College. Her expertise and persistent feedback were instrumental in guiding me through my literature review and enhancing the quality of my research. With her guidance, I am prepared to undertake further studies on the Political Socialization of Defectors and explore their potential in addressing Democratic Deconsolidation through the use of big data and text analysis by fine-tuning machine learning models.</p>
