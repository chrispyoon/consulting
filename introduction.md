    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This research is based on the concept of Conditional Inclusion, a framework that delves into the factors affecting the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors. Conditional Inclusion posits that society's acceptance of defectors hinges on their perceived utility and conformity to social norms. Essentially, defectors who contribute economically and socially are more likely to be accepted and integrated into society.
           Hackl (2022) explores this notion by comparing different immigrant groups and examining how societal acceptance is contingent on perceived usefulness. Hackl highlights the high expectations set by the public, suggesting that only those who demonstrate significant contributions are welcomed. Hackl states,

"The global relevance and urgency of conditional inclusion has become evident in the enthusiastic public reception of the volume... In these collections of essays, the editors describe 'The Good Immigrant' as a 'response to the narrative that immigrants are 'bad' by default until they prove themselves otherwise. They are job stealers, benefit scroungers, girlfriend thieves, and criminals. Only when they win an Olympic medal, treat you at your local hospital, or rescue a child from the side of a building do they become good'" (p. 994). 

           Hackl further elaborates on Selective Inclusion, where the integration of marginalized groups is conditional upon their alignment with dominant cultural and political norms. For North Korean defectors in South Korea, this means gaining social status by publicly denouncing the North Korean regime and fitting into the preferred narrative:

"North Koreans living in South Korea, for example, are invited to gain social status by speaking publicly about their lives and denouncing the North Korean regime... Such encompassment is 'always hierarchical', as 'the putatively subordinate category of difference is subsumed or co-opted into the identity category defined and 'owned' by those who do the encompassing' (Baumann 2004, 26). 'Good immigrants' can thereby be recognized as citizens, but only if they accept the co-optation of their difference and identity under the dominant framework" (p. 996).
 
           Hough and Bell (2020) provide a critical perspective on how defectors navigate societal expectations and the conditional nature of their acceptance. They observe that defectors often have to align their narratives with the dominant human rights discourse to be accepted:

"When t'albungmin are offered public forums to speak but encouraged to recount memories that fit into a paradigmatic narrative of 'human rights violations,' there is little public space in which they can speak of experiences not reducible to a human rights framework. Taken as representatives of an enemy state and members of a suspect community within South Korea, North Koreans' belonging in the ROK is tenuous and contingent on their ability to continuously prove themselves worthy" (p. 15).
          
           To support this framework, we also incorporate the findings of Wu et al. (2022), which emphasize the significant role of perceived social support in life satisfaction. Their research shows:
 
"Perceived social support was significantly positively correlated with Chinese medical staff's life satisfaction (r = 0.659, p < 0.01)" (p. 7).

           The squared value of 0.659, 0.434, implies that social support accounts for 43.4% of life satisfaction, and socio-demographic and job-related factors account for the remaining variance. The paper explains that:
 
"Perceived social support could not only separately impact Chinese medical providers' life satisfaction through resilience or depression, but could also indirectly affect their life satisfaction via the chain mediation effect of resilience and depression" (p. 9).

           Choi (2016) reveals that the media often frames defectors in stereotypical ways, which can impact public perceptions and attitudes toward them. Choi highlights the need for more balanced and positive media representations to enhance societal acceptance. The study indicates that media can either reinforce negative stereotypes or challenge them by providing more nuanced and positive portrayals. Furthermore, Choi's findings emphasize that,
 
"the TV news programs represent the positive image of the South Korean government whereas they criticize the North Korean government while representing North Korean defector is-sues. However, the TV news programs showed no interest in real problems which the North Ko-rean defectors are experiencing" (p. 1).

           This suggests that media coverage often overlooks the actual challenges faced by defectors, instead focusing on broader political narratives. 
           Additionally, Ramasubramanian (2011) suggests that positive media representation can influence public attitudes and foster support for inclusive policies. This is crucial for understanding how media portrayals can enhance life satisfaction among defectors:
 
"just the simple presence of counterstereotypical characters of color in entertainment shows can bring about significant attitude change even in the absence of motivation or cognitive resources to do so" (p. 510).

           Thus, the framework of Conditional Inclusion, complemented by perceived social support and positive media representation, provides a comprehensive theoretical foundation for understanding the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors.
