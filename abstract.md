    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This study investigates the impact of public sentiment and thematic narratives on the life satisfaction of North Korean defectors within the framework of Conditional Inclusion. This framework posits that societal acceptance depends on perceived utility and conformity to norms. By analyzing blog posts from 2014 to 2023, the research examines how different themes and sentiments influence the well-being and societal integration of defectors in South Korea.

    <p>
      The findings demonstrate that while positive sentiment and empowering narratives contribute to the life satisfaction and societal acceptance of defectors, their integration remains governed by conditional inclusion. To foster genuine acceptance and well-being for North Korean defectors, future research should address broader societal attitudes and policies that support unconditional integration, recognizing their inherent worth and diverse contributions.
