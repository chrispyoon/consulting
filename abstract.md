      The research also includes a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis to understand the impact of economic satisfaction and media representation on the social life satisfaction of defectors. The MLR model incorporates variables such as economic stability, media portrayal, and personal experiences to provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing defectors' integration.
